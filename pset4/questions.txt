0.  Supported different colors
	BMP: 24 bits colors so 16.7 million colors (2^24).
	GIF: 8 bits so 256 colors (2^8).
	JPEG: 24 bits so 16.7 million colors (2^24).
	PNG: 24 bits so 16.7 million colors (2^24).
    
1.  GIF

2.  Lossy means that the used compression method creates 
    an image that could be of less quality than the original.
    Lossless means that the image doesn't lose any details/quality.
    
3.  JPEG

4.  When a file is deleted the metadata that pointed to the file
    is deleted, but the file itself doesn't get overwritten. This
    means that the file is still there, just the information of its
    location gets deleted.

5.  Erase the disk completely by rewriting every bit with either 
    0's or 1's.

6.  stdint.h is a header file which provides a set of typedefs 
    that specify exact-width integer types. So stdint.h includes 
    structs that define different types of ints.
    
7.  To specify how many bits need to be allocated to store a value
    ( 8 meaning 8 bits, 32 meaning 32 bits and u- (uint8_t) means the
    integer is unsigned (= only positive values). So each serves
    a purpose in a different context.

8.  BYTE    = 1 Byte, 8 bits
    DWORD   = 4 Bytes, 32 bits
    LONG    = 4 Bytes, 32 bits
    WORD    = 2 Bytes, 16 bits

9.  In hexadecimal it must be: 42 4D, or in decimal: 66, 77.

10. biSize is the size of only the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure.
    bfSize is the size of the whole bitmap file.

11. If biHeight is negative it means the image is top-down 
    DIB (device-independent bitmap). So the start of the image
    is in the top left corner. If biHeight would be positive
    the start of the image would be in the bottem left corner.

12. biBitCount

13. If the fopen fails to write the output file. For example if the user 
    is unauthorized to create the file, or there is not enough space available.

14. The third argument specifies the size (in this case the 
    size of BITMAPINFOHEADER) fread needs to read.
    In copy.c fread always reads 1 struct (BITMAPINFOHEADER), so 1 element.

15. 3   =   ((4 - (3 * 3) % 4) % 4)

16. It sets the file position indicator to a new specified location.

17. It specifies fseek to move from the current position in the file.
