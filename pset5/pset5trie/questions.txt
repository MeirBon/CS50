0.  Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis is the longest word in the English language published in a dictionary.
    It is a long disease.
    
1.  It returns resource usage measures like CPU usage and memory usage.

2.  16

3.  If they are passed as values, the whole structs will be copied into calculate which wastes memory and cpu usage.

4.  First load a textfile and a dictionary. When everything is loaded loop through every char of a word, if it's alphabetical or an apostrophe then add the char to an array called word,
    if a char is numeric or longer than the max length (45), the word is invalid to be checked. If a word is invalid, the index gets reset to prepare for a new word.
    Check if char is a number, if so it is not checkable so loop to end of line and reset index to prepare for a new word. 
    If all goes well we have a word that needs checking (= index >0). Terminate the current word and update the counter for the next word in the loop. 
    Check spelling, if the word is mispelled it is printed on screen for the user. 
    Reset the index to prepare for a new word.

5.  You first have to allocate memory with scanf, there are no limits on the strings length 
    and with fgetc we are able to check numerical inputs and other symbols easier. 

6.  The input that check and load get need to remain original. We just have to check the input, not modify it. This ensures the files
    stay original.
